     <h1><center>Theodore Hui - Python scripts</center></h1>
     <p>Hey, my name is Theodore Hui, I'm an incoming sixth college Data Science major, and I wrote all the python scripts for this project. SPIS taught me everything I know about python, and I'm very excited to learn more, as well as pursue machine learning and ai, in my Data Science classes at UCSD. A little more about myself, I took piano lessons for 10 years but still play like a beginner, but I've also been a percussionist through high school and am a sucker for anything DCI related. Also throughout SPIS I've been teaching myself how to play guitar, hmu if you have any tips on how to play barr chords without dying.</p>
